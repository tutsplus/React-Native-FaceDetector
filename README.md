### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Create a Face Detection App With React Native

#### Instructor: Wernher-Bel Ancheta

Are you a hybrid app developer wanting to include face detection into your app, but you don't have any idea where to start? As a start, you could read [An Introduction to Face Detection on Android](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-face-detection-on-android--cms-25212), which shows you how to natively implement face detection on Android. But if you are like me and you don't want to write Java code to create a React Native module that does this for you, then you are in the right place.

In this tutorial, we look at the [Face Detection API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api/documentation/overview), which is part of [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services). This API allows developers to easily implement face detection functionality in apps. In this tutorial, I am going to assume that this isn't your first React Native app. If you are new to React Native, then I recommend you first read Facebook's [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) tutorial on the React Native website. That tutorial shows you how to set up your environment and create your first React Native project.
